My dotfiles

To use:
```
./bootstrap.sh
```

NOTE: Because of the way the oh-my-zsh install script works, it switches your shell after it's done installing. Type `exit` to let the script continue running after that point.

Also make sure to set your font to FuraCode Nerd Font and check use ligitures...it's installed in the bootstrap script.
